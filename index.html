          was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans">American</a> adult film actor and bodybuilder, affectionately nicknamed <em>"Aniki"</em> (兄貴, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-language">jp</a>. "Big Brother")
          in the Japanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community">online communities</a>. <br>
          In the late 2000s, his appearances in various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_pornography">gay pornography</a> movies led him to become a popular Internet meme on video-sharing websites such as Japan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niconico">Nico Nico Dōga</a>,
          where he was referred to by the sobriquet "Aniki" (兄貴, lit. "older brother").

    <h3><center>Online history</center></h3>
    <br>
    <p>Born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island">Long Island, New York</a>, Herrington began pursuing his acting career after his high school graduation in 1996
      when one of his nude submissions won him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playgirl"><em>Playgirl</em></a> magazine's <em>"Real Men of the Month"</em> contest. His appearance in the magazine caught the eye of famed photographer
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_French_(photographer)">Jim French</a>, but it was two years before Herrington posed for his first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Studio_Group">Colt</a> calendars for French.
      <br> In the following years, Herrington modeled for French nude calendars and starred in a number of hardcore adult films that made him one of the best known same-sex adult
      films stars of the late 1990s, appearing on mainstream TV programs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Connection"><em>Love Connection</em></a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricki_Lake_(1993_talk_show)"><em>Ricki Lake</em></a> talk show.
      <br>However, his internet fame began many years later on September 30th, 2007 with the upload of a video clip from
      Herrington's <em>"Workout Muscular Men 3"</em> via video-sharing community <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niconico"><em>Nico Nico Douga (NND)</em></a>. Titled <em>"Professional Pants-Wrestling"</em>
      (jp. 本格的 ガチムチパンツレスリング), the video gained more than 5.5 million views in less than five years.</p>

          many of which utilize deliberate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen">mishearings</a> of lines from his films. He is affectionately called "Aniki" (兄貴, lit. older brother) among the Nico Nico Douga community, and most of his videos are deliberately mistagged with "Wrestling Series" (レスリングシリーズ, <em>resuringu shirīzu</em>), "Forest Fairy" (森の妖精, <em>mori no yōsei</em>), "Philosophy" (哲学, <em>tetsugaku</em>), or all three.
          <br>In February 2009, Herrington visited Japan to attend a live online event hosted by Niconico and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_kit">garage kit</a> maker <em>Good Smile Company</em>. Herrington said that he is flattered and humbled by his fans' creativity. A limited-edition Herrington figure was announced for a July 2009 release. Two other limited-editions Herrington action figures were announced for the Halloween and Christmas holiday. The Halloween figure was released in October 2009 and the Christmas one was released in December 2009; both are Nico Nico Chyokuhan exclusives.

          The petition needed 25,000 signatures, which it acquired, meaning Zelensky is now legally obligated to consider the proposal. The proposed idea is claimed to be a way to remove Russian influence from Odessa, while the statue which would be of Billy Herrington Drinking Beer.</p>
